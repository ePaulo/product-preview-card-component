# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component

![Design preview for the Product preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

The challenge was to build out the product preview card component and get it looking as close to the mobile and desktop designs as possible using Responsive CSS styles.

The mobile and desktop design images are located inside the `/design` folder.

The icon and image assets are in the `/images` folder. The assets were provided optimized.

There is a `style-guide.md` file containing the design color palette and fonts.

## My process

### Built with

HTML-5 semantic tags
CSS-3 responsive code with flexbox
focus on making the code adhere to current accessibility standards

### What I learned

I had to learn how to use the &lt;picture&gt; tag to setup two different image source files, visible depending on view-screen width.
